description: Multimedia coding aims to compress source data efficiently to transmit them using less bandwidth and to save the data in a more compact way. Many algorithms have been developed to relieve the constraints on storage space and transmission capacities and are currently used in products on the shelf. In this project, the steps of implementation of the LBG algorithm for CD-Quality audio signals are
explained and the performance evaluation of the technique used is shown.
